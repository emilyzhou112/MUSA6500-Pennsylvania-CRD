# Progress Report for MUSA650 Final Project

### Project Member: Emily Zhou, Shuai Wang
Our group’s final project is inspired by Alvarez-Mendoza et al (2020).'s study on Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) prevalence estimation in Quito, Ecuador. We replicated and improved upon their methodology in predicting CRD hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using a combination of remote sensing and air quality data. By running this using four machine learning models, we seek to understand the significant environmental factors contributing to CRD risk in PA and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms. 

At this point, we are over halfway through our project. As we progress through the conceptualization and data exploration phase, we’ve made the following deviations from the original study. Firstly, we decided to conduct the analysis at a standard spatial unit. Since our raw data all comes from different sources and with different geographic unit (eg. hospital discharge data are collected at a county level while remote sensing data are at 30*30m spatial resolution), we divide Pennsylvania into 8397 5000*5000m contiguous fishnet grids. Doing so provide a regular and systematic way to divide geographic areas into smaller units. It simplifies our analysis by providing a structured framework for organizing and processing spatial data.

Our second deviation from the original study has to do with the availability of air quality data in Pennsylvania. Because the influence of air quality monitoring stations is not limited by administrative boundaries, making spatial interpolation of their influence zone becomes an important step before analysis. We computed several Voronoi polygons based on station locations that collect different kinds of air quality data. Each station is associated with a polygon representing the area where it has the closet proximity, from which we could then aggregate to the fishnet.  The third deviation is that we took seasonality into account while running the machine learning model. Specifically, models are run on data from different seasons separately for cross-comparison.

In terms of the overall implementation of the project, our accomplishment so far includes study area definition, remote sensing data processing, and hospital discharge data cleaning. To elaborate, we have divided Pennsylvania into 8397 fishnet grids for structured analysis. We have retrieved, refined, manipulated satellite images from google earth engine into a suitable format (csv files) for analysis, and have calculated vegetation indices crucial for environmental assessment. We have cleaned and aggregated the hospital discharge data to the fishnet grids for analysis later. On top of that, we have started to combine remote sensing data with hospital discharge data onto the same table and are in the process of collecting air quality data. 

Moving forward, our main task include finish collecting the air quality data, building Voronoi polygons around air quality monitoring stations and aggregate station information into the fishnet. We plan to perform dimensionality reduction on all of our predictor variables using the Bayesian Information criteria to select the most influential predictor of CRD in order to prevent multi-collinearity and overfitting. Eventually, we will run four machine learning models (linear regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, and multiple layer perceptron) for each seasons’ data and compare their accuracy. We will organize our project into a GitHub repository to ensure reproducibility!
