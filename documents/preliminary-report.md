# Preliminary Report for MUSA650 Final Project

### Project Member: Emily Zhou, Shuai Wang

In this final project, we will investigate the effectiveness of several machine learning models in predicting the number of hospital discharge patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) using environmental and air quality variables. We plan to replicate and improve upon Alvarez-Mendoza et al.’s 2020  study of CRD’s spatial distribution in Ecuador by conducting the analysis in the state of Pennsylvania. Our goal is to understand the most significant environmental and atmospheric factors leading to higher CRD risk in Pennsylvania as well as to compare the performance of different machine learning models. We intend to use remote sensing data, air quality data, and hospital discharge data in this project. Specifically, we will retrieve Landsat 8 Level 2 Tier 1 data from Google Earth Engine with a spatial resolution of 30m. We plan to obtain median satellite images by season from 2022, from which we will compute the NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and Land Surface Temperature. The hospital discharge data is collected by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and available for the public to download from their webpage. The air quality data is collected through various pollutants monitoring sites across the state and distributed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The variables we intend to include are PM2.5, CO, O3, SO2, and NO2. To combine vector with raster data and to standardize the spatial unit of our analysis, we will aggregate all variables into a fishnet grid of Pennsylvania using either zonal statistics or area-weighted reaggregation. Subsequently, we will perform dimensionality reduction on our predictor variables to avoid multicollinearity. We plan to fit four machine learning models: simple OLS regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, and multiple-layer perceptron. The root mean square error (RMSE) will be computed to compare across models.
